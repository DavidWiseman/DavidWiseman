Hi, I'm a SQL Server DBA and enjoy writing T-SQL code and performance tuning.  I created a monitoring tool for SQL Server called [DBA Dash](https://github.com/trimble-oss/dba-dash) that is my main open source contribution.  I also created some Active Directory tools called Password Control and Bulk AD Users early in my career.
